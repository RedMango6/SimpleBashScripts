# SimpleBashScripts
In this repository, I'm storing any bash programs I make in the process of reviewing Linux.
Below are descriptions for what each bash script does.

--fullPublicPerms.txt--
fullPublicPerms.txt is incredibly and satisfyingly simple. It takes one argument, the name of a file, and adds full rwx permissions for "others" to that file.

--addTaha--
This bash script take on argument, the name of a file, and appends "Taha" to the file. "Taha" is appended on a new line.
